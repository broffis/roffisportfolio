This is Brandon Roffis's first website

There are 8 total files, 5 HTML, 2 CSS, and 1 Javascript that power the site.

Design was intended to invoke thoughts of reading a newspaper with your morning coffee.

Future intent is to add adjust the way the gallery is set up to link to blog posts about various coffee shops, restaurants, and life stories experienced.
